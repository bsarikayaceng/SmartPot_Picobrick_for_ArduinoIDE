# ðŸŒ± PicoBricks Smart Pot

The **PicoBricks Smart Pot** is an educational IoT project that automates plant watering using the ESP32-based PicoBricks platform. It is designed to monitor soil moisture and control watering via a relay module, with manual override and threshold configuration using an IR remote.

## ðŸ§  Project Description

This project helps you build a smart plant pot that waters itself based on soil moisture. Using the OLED screen, users can view real-time soil values. The IR remote is used to set a soil moisture threshold for automatic watering.

When soil moisture drops below the threshold, the relay activates a pump or valve. A buzzer also alerts the user, providing both visual and auditory feedback.
